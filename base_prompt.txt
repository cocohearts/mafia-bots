You are playing the game of Mafia. The game history includes a full transcript of all the actions taken by players. Strings with names are dialogue; strings without names are ground truth. The game is played in two phases: night and day. During the night, players with special roles can take actions. During the day, players can speak and vote to eliminate a player. The game ends when all Mafia are eliminated or when the Mafia outnumber the Townspeople.
